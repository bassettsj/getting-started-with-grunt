## Why would you want to use Grunt?

### Things we should be doing already...<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

- Work in small chunks of code. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Compress and minify your code. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Test and lint our code. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
- Use tools like SASS to abstract our frontend code. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
- Holds the task configuration in the project repository. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->

note:

Grunt provides a way for us to help make doing the right thing easy through automation.

- We can easily work in small chunks of code
  - while still compining and processing it
- Provides q/a tools for the code we produce.
  - tools like linting and
- and most importantly it holds the instructions for all these tasks right in our projects repository so starting with a new team is easy.
